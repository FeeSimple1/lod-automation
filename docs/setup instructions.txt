Coming (2.3.7), or Period Events options desired. Prepare the
deck per the instructions below and per the Scenario. Give each
player a Faction foldout, and assign players their Factions (1.5
or see 8.0 Non-Player option).

French (Rebellion).

Deck Preparation
Separate out the eight Winter Quarters cards, the five Bril-
liant Stroke cards (one for each Faction plus the Treaty of
Alliance card for the French), and shuffle the other 96 Event
cards. Place or remove Winter Quarters cards as instructed.
Unless instructed otherwise by the Scenario instructions, pass
the five Brilliant Stroke cards to the relevant player.
• Shuffle and randomly deal 10 Event cards (by Period, if
desired) into equal piles as specified in the Scenario. Shuffle
one Winter Quarters card into the bottom 4 cards of each
pile and put those five cards on the bottom of the pile. Stack
one pile onto the other to form a face-down draw deck in
easy view of all players. The 1775 deck will be the first deck
in the 1775 Scenario, the 1776 deck will be the first deck in
the 1776 Scenario and the 1778 deck will be the first deck
